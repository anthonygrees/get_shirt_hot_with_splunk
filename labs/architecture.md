### About
Splunk Validated Architectures (SVAs) are proven reference architectures for stable, efficient and repeatable Splunk deployments. Many of Splunk's existing customers have experienced rapid adoption and expansion, leading to certain challenges as they attempt to scale. At the same time, new Splunk customers are increasingly looking for guidelines and certified architectures to ensure that their initial deployment is built on a solid foundation. SVAs have been developed to help our customers with these growing needs.
